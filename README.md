This is a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys Terraform configurations to Azure whenever there's a push to the `main` branch of your repository. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `name: 'Terraform deploy GitHub Actions'`: This is the name of your GitHub Actions workflow.

2. `on: push: branches: - main`: This specifies that the workflow should be triggered whenever there's a push to the `main` branch.

3. `jobs: terraform: name: 'Terraform'`: This starts the definition of a job called `Terraform`.

4. `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`: This specifies that the job should run on the latest version of the Ubuntu virtual environment provided by GitHub Actions.

5. `defaults: run: working-directory: ./terraform`: This sets the default working directory for all the steps in the job to `./terraform`.

6. `steps:`: This starts the definition of the steps that the job will execute.

7. `- name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v2`: This step checks out your repository so the workflow can access its contents.

8. `- name: Login to Azure uses: azure/login@v1 with: creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}`: This step logs into Azure using the credentials stored in the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.

9. `- name: Setup Terraform uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1`: This step sets up Terraform.

10. `- name: Terraform Init run: terraform init`: This step initializes your Terraform configuration.

11. `- name: Terraform Validate run: terraform validate`: This step validates your Terraform configuration.

12. `- name: Terraform Plan run: terraform plan`: This step creates an execution plan for your Terraform configuration.

13. `- name: Terraform Apply run: terraform apply -auto-approve`: This step applies the changes specified in your Terraform configuration. The `-auto-approve` option means it will not prompt for approval.
